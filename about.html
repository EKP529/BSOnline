    <h2>Game Synopsis</h2>
    <p>
        BSOnline is an online card game where players seek to be the first
        to discard all the cards in their hand. Each player, in turn,
        announces the card and the amount that they want to discard. During
        a player's turn, each other player has 7 seconds to call that player's
        bluff. After 7 seconds, if no call is made the player's discard is accepted
        and the next player plays. If a player's bluff is correctly called that
        player must assume all the cards in the pile, if the bluff is incorrectly
        called, the calling player must pick up the pile. The game continues in this
        manner until the first player discards all of their cards.
