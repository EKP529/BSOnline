# startup
The startup application for CS 260; BSOnline




## Notes(3/16): 
I learned a bit more about Git and GitHub and made some conflicting changes
that I fixed. I'm more comfortable with GitHub now, but it still may take some getting used to
as well as some further improvement which will come as I go along.


## Elevator Pitch for BSOnline: 
Everyone’s cards are up and against their chests. Deception is in 
the air and ***no one*** can be trusted. Does everyone have what they say they have, or is it just BS? 
**Sniff out the liars, and they’ll pay the price, but call out the innocent and the price is _yours_ 
to pay.** What will you do? This is **BS**! Perhaps you’ve played the card game before? What if this BS 
fun went _digital_, and you could play with friends from your laptop or phone? With **BSOnline**, that 
imagination becomes **reality**!
