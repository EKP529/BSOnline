The startup application for CS 260; BSOnline


## Elevator Pitch for BSOnline: 
Everyone’s cards are up and against their chests. Deception is in 
the air and ***no one*** can be trusted. Does everyone have what they say they have, or is it just BS? 
**Sniff out the liars, and they’ll pay the price, but call out the innocent and the price is _yours_ 
to pay.** What will you do? This is **BS**! Perhaps you’ve played the card game before? What if this BS 
fun went _digital_, and you could play with friends from your laptop or phone? With **BSOnline**, that 
imagination becomes **reality**!

## CSS Startup Takeaways(5/1):
What I learned from the CSS Startup deliverable:
* I learned what the `calc()` does for values
* I learned about bootstrap limitations and debugging kinks in its use and overwriting
* I learned about display kinks between desktop/laptop and mobile; I had to change the units I used
in order to accommodate both mobile and desktop views
